Project 1
Project start date: June 23 2023.
Project completion date: June 28 2023.
I am enrolled in The Odin Project learning skills and languages for a new career in web development.
This project serves as the basis for a simple recipe website.
With this project, I will demonstrate my ability to code and write HTML. Later on, I will update this project to incorporate CSS and possibly JavaScript.
Thanks for viewing my project!

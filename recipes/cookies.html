    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup unsalted butter, softened (preferably European-style)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In the bowl of a stand mixer with the paddle attachment, or in a large mixing bowl with a hand mixer, beat together the butter, sugar, vanilla extract, and salt on medium-high speed until pale and fluffy, about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the flour and mix on low speed until it forms a stiff dough. The dough might seem too dry at first but kep beating, stopping halfway through to scrape down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula. Stop mixing as soon as it comes together.</li>
        <li>For cut-out cookies: Place a large piece of plastic wrap on the counter. Scrape the dough out of the mixing bowl onto the plastic wrap. Shape the dough into a disk about 1-inch thick. You can use the plastic to help shape the dough without it sticking to your hands. Seal the dough in the plastic and place it in the refrigerator to chill until firm, at least 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>For slice-and-bake cookies: Place a large piece of plastic wrap on the counter. Scrape the dough out of the mixing bowl onto the plastric wrap. Shape the dough into a log about 2 1/2-inch in diameter. You can use the plastic to help shape the dough without it sticking to your hands. Seal the dough in the plastic and place it in the refrigerator to chill until firm, at least 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Arrange racks in the lower and upper thirds of the oven. Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>For cut-out cookies: Dust your work surface generously with flour. If the dough feels too stiff to roll easily, gently press the rolling pin firmly into the dough repeatedly tapping over the whole surface of the dough to make it more pliable. Roll the dough 1/4 to 1/2-inch thick, rolling from the center outward in all directions. Lift and rotate a bit after every few strokes and dust with flour as needed to discourage sticking. Cut out cookies using a 2 1/2-inch round cookie cutter. Space the cookies about 1-inch apart on parchment-lined baking sheets. The scraps can be gathered a couple more times to roll and cut out more cookies.</li>
        <li>For slice-and-bake cookies: Use a sharp knife to slice cookies about 1/4 to 1/2-inch thick. Space the cookies about 1-inch apart on parchment-lined baking sheets.</li>
        <li>Bake cookies until they start to turn lightly golden on the bottom and edges, about 20 minutes, rotating the pans halfway through. The middle of the cookies should look matte and feel dry to the touch. The baking time will depend on how thick the cookies are. For larger cookies you may need more time, so start with an extra 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Allow the cookies to cool on the pans for 10 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
        <li>Shortbread cookies can be stored in an airtight container on the counter for up to 1 week. It's hard to believe they get even better, but the buttery flavour actually improves over time.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Bon appetit!</p>

    <p>If you're looking for a pizza that will bring more greens into your life, this delicious sheet pan pizza is the one for you.</p>
    <p>Spinach and artichoke might not seem like ideal pizza toppings, but these flavours are incredible with melted cheese.</p>
    <p>Don't believe me? Follow this recipe to try it for yourself.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>1 ounce pizza dough</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon italian seasoning</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
        <li>1 6-ounce bag baby spinach</li>
        <li>1 12- to 14-ounce jar marinated artichoke hearts, drained thoroughly, and sliced if needed</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups (6 ounces) shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>crushed red pepper flakes, optional</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 450°F.</li>
        <li>Position an oven rack in the lower half of the oven. Grease a 13x18-inch baking sheet with 1 tablespoon of olive oil.</li>
        <li>Generously flour a surface, then turn the dough out onto the board. Use a rolling pin to roll the dough into a large rectangle. If refrigerated dough is too hard to roll, set for 20 minutes to reach room temperature, then roll it out.</li>
        <li>Transfer the dough to the oiled sheet pan and stretch it out to the corners of the pan. If it springs back, wait several moments and try again.</li>
        <li>Drizzle 1 tablespoon of olive oil on the dough. Use your fingers to gently spread the oil all over. Try not to tear the dough. Sprinkle the italian seasoning evenly over the dough.</li>
        <li>Heat the remaining tablespoon of oil and garlic in a large skillet over medium heat. When the garlic bubbles, add the spinach, and saute for two minutes until the spinach wilts. Turn off the heat.</li>
        <li>If the dough shrunk away from the corners, give it a final stretch to reach the sides of the pan. Sprinkle half of the mozzarella over the pizza, followed by the spinach and then the artichokes. Sprinkle the rest with mozzarella.</li>
        <li>Bake the pizza for 12-15 minutes until the cheese is bubbly and golden brown.</li>
        <li>Use two spatulas to lift the pizza from the pan and transfer it to a large cutting board. Slice into squares. Add optional crushed red pepper flakes. Serve hot.</li>

    <p>Ready for a slice of something new and exciting? Keep reading to follow along.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds store-bought or homemade pizza dough</li>
        <li>8 ounces store-bought napa cabbage kimchi or homemade Quick Kimchi</li>
        <li>all-purpose flour, for dusting</li>
        <li>cornmeal, for dusting</li>
        <li>1 cup store-bought marinara sauce or homemade pizza sauce</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>8 ounces crumbled Italian sausage</li>
        <li>fresh basil leaves, for optional garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>If the dough is refrigerated, let it come to room temperature. Divide the dough in half, place both halves in a large bowl, and cover the bowl with plastic wrap to keep the dough from drying out.</li>
        <li>Position the oven rack in the center of the oven and place a pizza stone on it. Preheat the oven to 500°F for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Prepare the kimchi by chopping it into 1/4-inch pieces. Using your hands (gloves optional), squeeze the juices out of the kimchi so the dough doesn't get soggy. Pro tip: save the liquid for optional stew.</li>
        <li>Dust your countertop lightly with flour. Working with one portion (1 pound) of dough at a time, use a rolling pin to roll it into a 10- to 12-inch circle. You can also spread the dough out with your fingers.</li>
        <li>Prepare the pizza peel by spreading a thin layer of cornmeal on it, followed by the rolled-out dough on top.</li>
        <li>Spoon half of the marinara sauce on the dough and evenly spread it to the outer edges with the back of a spoon. Sprinkle half of the cheese over the sauce. Evenly distribute half of the sausage and squeezed kimchi.</li>
        <li>Carefully sprinkle some cornmeal onto the preheated pizza stone. Slide the pizza onto it and bake for 8-10 minutes, until the crust is golden brown and the sausage is cooked through. While the first pizza cooks, assemble the second pizza with the remaining ingredients.</li>
        <li>Remove the first pizza from the oven, transfer it onto a cutting board and let it cool for a few minutes. Sprinkle with optional fresh basil, slice, and serve.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Enjoy!</p>

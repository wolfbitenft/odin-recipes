    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 16-ounce loaf Italian bread or French bread</li>
        <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>2 large cloves garlic, smashed and minced</li>
        <li>1 heaping tablespoon chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese, optional</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350°F.</li>
        <li>Cut the loaf in half, horizontally. Mix the butter, garlic, and parsley together in a small bowl. Spread butter mixture over the two bread halves.</li>
        <li>Place the halves of bread on a sturdy baking pan and heat in an oven for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the pan from the oven. Sprinkle optional Parmesan cheese over bread. Return to oven on the highest rack.</li>
        <li>Broil on high heat for 2-3 minutes until the edges of the bread begin to toast (and the cheese bubbles). Watch closely as bread can burn easily.</li>
        <li>Remove from oven and let cool for a minute. Remove from pan and use a bread knife to cut into 1-inch thick slices. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Soft Garlic Bread</h2>
    <p>If you prefer your garlic bread soft instead of toasted and crunchy, this is the method for you.</p>
    <p>Ready to get started?</p>
    <p>Let's go!</p>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F.</li>
        <li>Mix the butter, garlic, and parsley together in a small bowl.</li>
        <li>Make 1-inch thick slices into the bread, but don't go all the way through -- just to the bottom crust. Put a teaspoon or two of the butter mixture between each slice, or between every other slice if you only want the garlic mixture on one side of the bread.</li>
        <li>Wrap the bread in aluminum foil and heat for 15 minutes in the oven, until the butter has melted and the bread has warmed.</li>
        <li>To serve, remove from foil and present the loaf wrapped in a clean tea towel. Tear off slices to eat.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Very nice!</p>
